## 🎯 Learning Path

This repository is organized in a progressive learning sequence, starting from the basics and advancing to complex OOP concepts.

### 📚 Core C++ Fundamentals

| Module | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **01_varconst** | Variables & Constants | Understanding variable declaration, initialization, and const keyword |
| **02_primitives** | Data Types & Primitives | Exploring data types, type modifiers, casting, strings, and user input |
| **03_operator** | Operators | Arithmetic, assignment, logical, and relational operators |
| **04_conditionals** | Control Flow | If-else statements, switch cases, and conditional logic |
| **05_loops** | Loops & Iteration | For, while, do-while loops with practical tasks |
| **06_function** | Functions | Function declaration, definition, parameters, and return types |
| **07_array** | Arrays | Array manipulation, multi-dimensional arrays, and array operations |
| **08_oops** | Object-Oriented Basics | Introduction to classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and constructors |

### 🏗️ Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs-Detail)

The `Oops-Detail` folder contains in-depth coverage of advanced OOP concepts:

#### 🔐 Access Modifiers
- Public, Private, and Protected modifiers
- Friend functions and classes
- Access control in inheritance

#### 🏗️ Constructors & Destructors
- Default constructors
- Parameterized constructors
- Copy constructors (Shallow vs Deep copy)
- Destructor order of execution
- Virtual destructors

#### 🎭 Polymorphism
- **Compile-time Polymorphism:**
  - Function overloading
  - Operator overloading
- **Runtime Polymorphism:**
  - Function overriding
  - Virtual functions

#### 🔑 Keywords & Concepts
- `const` keyword (variables, functions, objects)
- `explicit` keyword
- `final` keyword
- `this` pointer
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions

#### 👥 Member Functions
- Static member functions and variables
- Const member functions
- Inline functions
- Outside class function definitions

#### 📊 Class vs Struct
- Differences between class and struct
- Inheritance differences
- Use cases and best practices
